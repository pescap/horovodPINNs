# HorovodPINNs

Data-based parallel Physics-informed neural networks via Horovod. Its code comes with the preprint entitled:

$h$-analysis and data-parallel physics-informed neural networks, P. Escapil-Inchausp√© and G. A. Ruz.

We apply data-based Horovod acceleration to pioneer [PINNs](https://github.com/maziarraissi/PINNs/) code by Raissi, Perdikaris and Karniadakis. Horovod acceleration is inspired by Xihui Meng [Distributed-training-Horovod](https://github.com/XuhuiM/Distributed-training-Horovod) code.

The aim of this repository is two-fold:

1. To fully replicate and reproduce the results in the manuscript, including the figures generation; 
2. To understand better how to apply Horovod based data-parallel acceleration to PINNs or physics-informed machine learning schemes.


Backend: `tensorflow.compat.v1`.
